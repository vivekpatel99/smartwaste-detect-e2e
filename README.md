# ♻️ Smart Waste Detection - End-to-End Project 🗑️

This project aims to develop an end-to-end solution for smart waste detection and segregation using object detection techniques. The system will be able to identify different types of waste from images and provide information for proper disposal.
## About Dataset
This Image dataset has been divided into train and val folders and into Biodegradable and non-biodegradable folders.

Each category has 4 classes. 
**For Biodegradable class:** paper, leaf, food, wood

**For Non-Biodegradable class:** ewaste, plastic bags, plastic bottles, metal cans

## 🚀 Project Workflow

The project will follow these key steps:

### 1. ✍️ Data Annotation
*   **Manual Annotation:** Manually annotate 20% of the dataset with bounding boxes for each waste type.
    *   Tools: Roboflow
*   **Initial Model Training:** Use these initial annotations to train a preliminary object detection model.

### 2. 🧠 Model Training
*   **Model Selection:** Train a state-of-the-art object detection model (e.g., YOLOv8, EfficientDet) on the manually annotated subset.
*   **Evaluation & Tuning:** Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results.

### 3. 🤖 Semi-Automatic Annotation
*   **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict bounding boxes on the remaining 80% of the dataset.
*   **Active Learning:** Review and correct a sample of the auto-annotated images to ensure quality and iteratively improve the model.

### 4. 💪 Full Model Retraining
*   **Data Merging:** Combine all annotated data (manual annotations + verified auto-annotations).
*   **Final Training:** Retrain the object detection model on the complete dataset for improved accuracy and robustness.

### 5. 🖥️ User Interface
*   **Development:** Build a simple web-based user interface.
    *   Frameworks: Streamlit
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Allow users to upload or drag-and-drop an image.
    *   Display the detected waste type(s) with bounding boxes.****
    *   Show confidence scores and class names for each detection.
    *   Optionally, provide suggestions for proper disposal or recycling 🌿.

### 6. 📊 Documentation & **Visualization**
*   **Visualizations:** Include:
    *   Sample predictions.
    *   Confusion matrix.
    *   Annotation examples.
*   **Demo:** Add a demo video or GIF showcasing the system's functionality.

### 7.  ☁️ Model Deployment
*   **Packaging:** Package the trained model as a REST API or Docker container for easy deployment.
*   **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy the user interface and model on a free cloud platform.
    *   Platforms: Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit Cloud, etc.

## ✨ Bonus Feature Ideas

*   **Batch Processing:** Allow users to upload and process multiple images at once.
*   **Mobile Compatibility:** Develop a lightweight version or a Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile use.
